Example project to test iframe integration.

After downloading the source, use `npm install` and `npm start` (you may also use yarn).


Obs: there is a php (`get-post-data.php`) file inside the `public` folder, which represents the page that will be opened inside the iframe. It just receives data through a POST method and show the values.
